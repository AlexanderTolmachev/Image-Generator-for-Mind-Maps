This a console utility which purpose is to generate images by .mm files - files which are created with the help of Free Mind program. Of course Free Mind supports an option of importation of mind maps to images, but the main idea of this project is to allow user to genrate images with preset options like style of map and to use this application for automatic display of mind maps on Interent sites or other resources.
This project is in process of development.
You may build this application with the help of CMake (CMakeLists.txt file is inclued).
Pay attantion that this project uses additional free libraries: pugixml library, Qt graphics library and boost property tree library. Pugixml files are situated in /lib directory. You may also download then from the official sourse: http://pugixml.org. But you need Qt have been instulled on your computer. You may download it from here: http://qt.nokia.com. Boost library is available here: http://www.boost.org. You also have to change paths to conformable Qt .lib (.a) files and all header files, that are used in this project in CMakeLists.txt file before building.
After building run the project with the command prompt. You need to specify a path to .mm file and a path to a file with map drawing settings as command prompt parametrs. It should be like this: 
ImgGenMM.exe test/Test_map.mm test/map_settings.txt
The format of file with drawing settings is the following:
MapSettings
{
	OutputFileName test_map.png
	OutputFileFormat PNG
	NodeStyle LINEAR
	EdgeStyle CURVED
}
The "NodeStyle" field may have a value "LINEAR" or "BUBBLE" and the "EdgeStyle" style filed may have a value "CURVED" or "STRAIGHT". Supported output file formats are "BMP", "JPG", "JPEG", "PNG", "TIFF", "PPM", "XBM" and "XPM".
You may see some example images in "example_images" directory. Test .mm file and file with map drawing settings are avaliable in "test" directory.
